# React Native - Albums Application

This project is my first React Native application. 

The products provides a nice and interactive layout of albums fetched from a provided API utilizing native fetch method and along with allowing for a quick check of related information, already allows you to buy the specified album right away - therefore showing its real utility. 
I have also followed best practices on fabricating reusable components (Button) with a changeable onPress handler.
